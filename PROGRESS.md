# Progress

Tracks state: files touched per phase, delegations, open questions. See
[`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) for the reasoning behind choices —
this file is allowed to go stale, that one isn't.

## Phase 0 (pre) — Scaffold pivot from the previous repo identity

**Owner:** main agent (not delegated — this predates the subagent split in
`.claude/commands/build-authz-service.md` §14, and is scaffolding/repo
surgery, not implementation).

**What this repo was, briefly:** a multi-tenant security kit (tenant
context propagation, RBAC, per-tenant rate limiting, audit logging,
Postgres row-level security, per-tenant encryption), published as an npm
library. See `docs/DECISIONS.md` D-001 through D-007 for what was kept,
what was removed, and why.

**Files touched:**

- Removed: `src/{tenant,rls,rbac,rate-limit,audit,crypto,http}/`,
  `src/errors.ts`, `src/index.ts`, their tests, `examples/`,
  `doc-examples/`, `docs/{tenant-isolation,row-level-security,rbac,
rate-limiting,audit-logging,encryption,auth-integrations,
versioning-policy}.md`, `.changeset/`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `scripts/{verify-dist-singleton,verify-docs}.mjs`, `tsup.config.ts`,
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- Repurposed, not deleted: `test/integration/rls-postgres.integration.test.ts`,
  `test/rls/postgres.test.ts`, `test/rls/postgres.fuzz.test.ts`, and
  `test/tenant/tenant-id.fuzz.test.ts` became
  `test/isolation/{permission-resolution.integration,
differential-soundness.fuzz, identifier-and-tuple-validation.fuzz}.test.ts`
  — real `.todo()` specs, not real assertions yet. See
  `test/isolation/README.md` for the file-by-file lineage.
- Added: `src/config/env.ts` + `.env.example` (the env loader — Phase-0
  scaffolding kept ahead of the phased build per `docs/DECISIONS.md` D-007),
  `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `.claude/commands/build-authz-service.md`,
  `.claude/agents/{schema-compiler,soundness-engineer,test-author,
report-designer}.md`, this file.
- Kept close to as-is: `.github/workflows/{ci,codeql,scorecard,
dependabot-auto-merge}.yml`, `.github/{CODEOWNERS,dependabot.yml,
ISSUE_TEMPLATE/,PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md}`, `docs/github-governance.md`
  (renumbered after removing the two publish-only steps), `.editorconfig`,
  `.prettierrc.json`, `eslint.config.js` (dropped dead ignores for removed
  dirs), `tsconfig.json` (dropped a dead exclude entry), `LICENSE`.
- Rewritten: `package.json` (private, unscoped name, dropped every
  npm-publish-only field, trimmed dependencies to what the kept/repurposed
  code actually needs — see `docs/DECISIONS.md`), `package-lock.json`
  (regenerated against the trimmed `package.json`), `README.md` (skeleton
  reflecting the new project's identity and honest current state),
  `vitest.config.ts` / `vitest.integration.config.ts` (integration tests
  now matched by `**/*.integration.test.ts` suffix since they live inside
  `test/isolation/` alongside the fuzz/unit tests they pair with, not in a
  separate `test/integration/` tree; coverage thresholds removed until
  there's real implementation coverage to hold a floor under).

**What's deliberately not built yet:** every phase in
`.claude/commands/build-authz-service.md` §9 — the schema DSL, the tuple
store, both resolvers, the differential-fuzzing harness, the API, and the
report/UI layer. `src/` currently contains only the Phase 0 env loader.
Building any of that now would be exactly the "write code before the spec
exists" mistake the build spec's own rule 0 warns against — see the spec
itself for what comes next.

**Verification run locally before this state was committed:** `npm run
lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (35 `.todo()` tests across the
repurposed isolation suite, 0 failures), `npm run test:integration` (15
`.todo()`), `npm run build` — all clean.

**Open questions carried into Phase 0 proper:**

- Postgres hosting (Railway, per this org's other services, or otherwise) —
  needs a real `DATABASE_URL` before Phase 2 can do anything.
- Whether `docs/github-governance.md`'s checklist has actually been applied
  to this repo's GitHub settings yet (branch protection, required status
  checks, Dependabot auto-merge, CODEOWNERS) — none of that is visible from
  the git tree; confirm before treating Phase 8's exit criteria as met.
